        <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a technology enthusiast. Whether it's automating tasks on my
          desktop, installing custom ROMs on my smartphone, or learning a new
          JavaScript feature or framework, I find technology endlessly
          fascinating. Staying up to date with the latest
          <s> ES6 ES2016 ES2017</s> ES.Next syntax feels like less of a chore
          and more of an opportunity to learn something new or gain a deeper
          understanding of an older topic. <br />
          <br />
          Within the US school system a career in technology was never presented
          as something for me, and as such I never chose to pursue it within the
          realm of traditional education. After graduating from UC Santa Barbara
          with a degree in Biological Anthropology I still found myself with a
          desire to continue learning. Now, after 10 months and countless hours
          of self-teaching, web development has grown from a fun hobby to my
          career choice.

        <h2>Here's what I can do. U like o wha?</h2>
        <p>
          With such a large and constantly growing selection of technology, I
          believe it is possible to find a framework or language for almost any
          imaginable use case. Conversely, there is also the potential to become
          enamored with the latest trendy framework and to begin using it for
          every project, even if it falls outside of that framework's ideal use
          case. For example, this website was built using exclusively HTML and
          CSS. No JavaScript, no Bootstrap, no extra libraries (you can check
          out my source here!). While I would have loved to use React, that
          would have been overkill for this simple static website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like this website, each of the following projects was designed to show
          my competence in a particular technology.
